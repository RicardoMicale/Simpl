# Simpl

Simpl is a simple programming language created with the purpose of practicing an learning about different concepts of programming. Following the guide of the book "Writing an interpreter in Go", written by Thorsten Ball, the Simpl language was created using Golang.

This language aims to be simple and provide with a set of tools, functions and methods to create scripts and to be more than just a practice project.

Right now this is just a rather incomplete version, but updates will come in the near future.
